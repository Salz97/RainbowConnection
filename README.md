# RainbowConnection
To run the application pull the backend and frontend code respectively. The backend code is connected to postgresSQL database.So you must create a database called rainbowconnection in postgresSQL in order for the database to appropriately populate. I ran my backend on localhost server port 8081 which is needed as this is what I use to connect the api to the frontend.
In application properties you need to also put the password of your SQL shell to allow the database to build when you run the backend.

I used Java and Springboot to run my backend application using JPA to interact with my SQL database.
I wrote my frontend with React JS.
